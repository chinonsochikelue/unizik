# Teacher Features Implementation

This document outlines the new teacher-specific features that have been implemented for the mobile application, including class roster management and attendance report generation.

## Overview

The teacher features provide comprehensive tools for educators to manage their classes, track student enrollment, and generate detailed attendance reports. The implementation follows a user-friendly approach with a class selector pattern that allows teachers to choose which class they want to work with before accessing specific features.

## Features Implemented

- Lists all classes assigned to the teacher
- Shows class name, code, description, and student count
- Dynamic header based on target feature (roster/reports)
- Pull-to-refresh functionality
- Empty state handling
- Responsive design with gradient styling

**Navigation:**
- From dashboard: Quick action buttons now route through ClassSelector
- URL pattern: `ClassSelector?targetScreen=roster` or `ClassSelector?targetScreen=report`
- Hidden from tab bar (utility screen)

Advanced attendance analytics and reporting for classes.

**Features:**
- **Report Summary:**
  - Total students and sessions
  - Average attendance rate
  - Highest/lowest attendance rates
  - Performance distribution statistics

- **Detailed Student Data:**
  - Individual attendance records
  - Session-by-session breakdown
  - Present, late, and absent counts
  - Attendance rate calculations

- **Date Range Selection:**
  - Custom date range picker
  - Default to last 30 days

    studentId: string
    email: string
  }
  totalSessions: number
  presentSessions: number
  lateSessions: number

  sessions: Array<{
    id: string
    date: string
    status: 'PRESENT' | 'LATE' | 'ABSENT'
    title: string
  }>
}
```

## API Service Updates

### New Methods Added to `services/api.ts`:

```typescript
// Class Roster Methods
getClassRoster(classId: string)
getAvailableStudents(classId: string, email?: string)
addStudentToClass(classId: string, studentId: string)
removeStudentFromClass(classId: string, studentId: string)
updateStudentRosterStatus(classId: string, studentId: string, status: string)
getClassDetails(classId: string)

// Attendance Report Methods
getClassAttendanceReport(classId: string, params: { startDate: string, endDate: string })
exportAttendanceReport(classId: string, format: string, params: any)

// Session Management
getClassSessions(classId: string, params?: any)
createClassSession(classId: string, data: any)
updateSession(sessionId: string, data: any)
deleteSession(sessionId: string)
```

## Navigation Flow

### 1. Dashboard â†’ Class Selector â†’ Feature
```
Teacher Dashboard 
    â†“ (Quick Action: Class Roster)
Class Selector (targetScreen=roster)
    â†“ (Select Class)
Class Roster (classId=selected)
```

### 2. Dashboard â†’ Class Selector â†’ Reports
```
Teacher Dashboard 
    â†“ (Quick Action: Attendance Reports)
Class Selector (targetScreen=report)
    â†“ (Select Class)
Attendance Report (classId=selected)
```

## UI/UX Design Patterns

### Consistent Design Language
- **Header:** Gradient blue background with white text
- **Cards:** White background with subtle shadows and rounded corners
- **Icons:** Ionicons with consistent sizing and colors
- **Loading States:** Animated indicators with skeleton content
- **Empty States:** Friendly messaging with appropriate icons

### Color Scheme
- **Primary Blue:** `#3b82f6` â†’ `#1d4ed8` (gradients)
- **Success Green:** `#10b981`
- **Warning Orange:** `#f59e0b`
- **Error Red:** `#ef4444`
- **Text Colors:** `#1e293b` (primary), `#64748b` (secondary), `#94a3b8` (tertiary)

### Responsive Behavior
- **Mobile:** Touch-optimized with proper spacing and tap targets
- **Web:** Mouse interactions with hover effects
- **Cross-platform:** Platform-specific file handling and sharing

## Error Handling & User Feedback

### Toast Notifications
- Success actions: Green toasts with checkmark icons
- Error states: Red toasts with warning icons
- Loading states: Neutral toasts with progress indicators
- Form validation: Warning toasts for invalid inputs

### Error Recovery
- Network failures: Retry buttons and refresh controls
- Data loading errors: Fallback UI with manual refresh options
- Permission errors: Clear messaging with alternative actions

## Testing & Debug Tools

### Debug Screen
**File:** `app/debug-teacher-features.tsx`

A comprehensive testing interface for validating teacher features:
- Test class selector navigation
- Direct feature access with custom class IDs
- Dashboard navigation validation
- Sample data testing with predefined IDs

**Usage:**
```bash
# Navigate to debug screen
/debug-teacher-features

# Test specific flows
Class Selector â†’ Roster (roster flow)
Class Selector â†’ Reports (reports flow)
Direct navigation with class IDs
```

## Installation & Setup

### Dependencies
All required dependencies are already included in the base project:
- `expo-router` for navigation
- `@expo/vector-icons` for icons
- `expo-linear-gradient` for UI gradients
- `react-native-safe-area-context` for layout handling
- `@react-native-community/datetimepicker` for date selection

### Configuration
1. Ensure API endpoints are properly configured in backend
2. Verify teacher role permissions are set up
3. Test with sample class and student data
4. Validate file export functionality on target platforms

## Backend Requirements

### Expected API Endpoints
```
GET /api/classes/teacher/roster/:classId
GET /api/classes/:classId/details
GET /api/classes/:classId/students/available
POST /api/classes/:classId/students
DELETE /api/classes/:classId/students/:studentId
PUT /api/classes/:classId/students/:studentId/status

GET /api/reports/attendance/:classId
GET /api/reports/attendance/:classId/export
GET /api/sessions/class/:classId
POST /api/sessions/class/:classId
```

### Data Models Required
- **Class:** id, name, code, description, studentCount
- **Student:** id, name, email, studentId, status, enrolledAt
- **Session:** id, classId, date, title, status
- **Attendance:** sessionId, studentId, status, timestamp

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
1. **Bulk Student Operations:** Import/export student lists via CSV
2. **Advanced Analytics:** Trending analysis and performance metrics
3. **Notification System:** Alerts for low attendance rates
4. **Integration Features:** Calendar sync and grade book integration
5. **Mobile Offline Support:** Local data caching and sync

### Performance Optimizations
1. **Lazy Loading:** Implement pagination for large student lists
2. **Caching Strategy:** Cache frequently accessed class data
3. **Image Optimization:** Student profile image loading and caching
4. **Background Sync:** Update data in background on app focus

## Support & Maintenance

### Common Issues
1. **Navigation Problems:** Ensure proper URL parameter passing
2. **API Errors:** Check network connectivity and endpoint availability
3. **Export Failures:** Verify platform-specific file handling permissions
4. **Performance Issues:** Monitor large dataset rendering performance

### Monitoring
- Track feature usage analytics
- Monitor API response times
- Collect user feedback on UX flow
- Performance metrics for large classes

This implementation provides a solid foundation for teacher class management while maintaining scalability and user experience standards.
